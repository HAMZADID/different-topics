            <h3> Civilization</h3>
            <p>
                The concept of civilization today is not a modern concept; it is a concept that has been in the foot since the existence of man on this earth. There is no civilization without man, no man without history, no civilization that does not belong to history; civilization is part of history, Its exact history, and every human being has his or her own culture. As civilization is the face of the other to man; and by showing the amount of strength, weakness, and progress, what is civilization? How did it arise? What theories have been developed to explain their origin? What is the difference between them and culture? This is what this article will discuss.
            </p>
            <h3>Definition of civilization</h3>
            <p>Civilization has known many definitions by anthropologists. Ralph Beddington said that the civilization of any people is only a package of intellectual and material tools that enable this people to fulfill their social and vital needs satisfactorily and also enable it to adjust to its environment in a suitable manner. Edward Taylor also defined civilization as a composite of all the beliefs, values, traditions, laws, information, arts, and any habits, behaviors, or potentials that an individual can get in a society. In the end, civilization can be defined as the material and moral legacy of man in the past, which man has depended upon to complete his current life and progress, whether it is moral aspects such as life style, daily life, science, knowledge or material tools that have remained the same as bricks, , And various handicrafts; such as porcelain, pottery, and others.

            <h3>
                The Rise of Civilizations
            </h3>
            <p>The emergence of civilizations on tribal bases, derived from the strength of the association of blood and kinship, so the tribe formed an urban area has many patterns, and habits of its own governing the behavior of its members in a single social format. It then began to evolve from tribal to religious, which in turn included many tribes. And then evolved into the political sphere that contributed to the integration of isolated groups with other groups. There have been many theories about the emergence of civilizations throughout history, and we review the most important of these theories in the following.</p>
             <h3>Environmental theory</h3>
             <p>This theory is important to the importance of environmental factors in the formation and formation of civilizations. This theory came to the world in the fifth century BC. Many Greek thinkers spoke about the impact of space, water, and atmosphere on man in his thinking and the nature of his creation. This theory also enumerates some of the prerequisites for the growth, growth, or degradation of civilizations, including: the presence of rain, the nature of the soil in terms of its suitability to agriculture, the high or low temperatures, and the nature of the geographical locat</p>
              <h3>Ibn Khaldun Theory</h3>
              <p>Ibn Khaldun presented his own analysis of the rise of civilizations. He touched on the impact of the environment on human biological characteristics, which determines their impact on their habits, behavior, mind and decisions. He said that climate plays an important and important role. If the climate in a region is hot, , Customs and traditions of a solid and warm nature, but whether it is moderate, for example, will result in moderate ideas and traditions, and so on. Ibn Khaldun described man as a civil being by nature, and called for the importance of sociology and the nature of human relations that lead to the emergence of systems that govern societies.</p>
<h3>Theory of sex or race</h3>
<p>Oswald Tsingloo, the historian of history, explained history according to the high and the ascetic destiny, and said that the emergence of civilizations goes through stages similar to the stages in which man passes. It is considered that the gender factor based on biological and functional differences between male and female is the basis for evaluating the work done within the community. Oswald says that every culture and civilization has its own unique character and uniqueness. All civilizations in the world are similar in their lifecycle from barbarism to primitive to urban, to the asset stage. , The fall of emotional values, and spiritual, finally ending a radical life stage. It has been proved at this time that this theory is historically useless. Historically, research and studies have shown that the human race in terms of biological composition is one, and that the termination of languages ​​for one origin does not mean the assumption of one sex. The element is not what makes civilization, but civilization arises under certain conditions, including environmental conditions, economic, and others.
</p>
<h3>Civilization and Culture</h3>
<p>Culture is generally defined as the data and concepts of the religious belief that prevails over a society, whether it is divine or non-catholic. These data and concepts form the hidden aspects of culture, such as emotional and spiritual domains, and the visual aspect of culture as product Literary, intellectual, and artistic it is influenced by culture significantly.
